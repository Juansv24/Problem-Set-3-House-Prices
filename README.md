# Problem Set 3
 

This repository contains the following folders:

- Docs: Contains thefinal document in `pdf` format usefull material and references for the project.
- Data: Contains all the data sets used. For this case, the data is compresed due to file size problems.
- Views: Contains all figures and tables-
- Scripts: Contains all the scripts necesary to replicate the results in the final document. 
   For this project we are going to work on two separate sripts:
   One for the descriptive statistics and one for the models and predicting tasks

The repository has two branches:

"Main" for the final work
"Test" to test codes and ideas that imply structural changes to the code. 
Use this to work on things you are not really sure they will work inmediately. For example: test models! When you are sure that they work submit a push to merge to main.
